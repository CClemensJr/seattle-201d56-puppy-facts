        <h3>HART is a non-profit 501(c)(3) no-kill animal rescue/support group, incorporated in 1990, that takes in and rehomes abused and unwanted dogs and cats. HART works with local veterinarians, foster homes, kennels, and trainers to provide temporary housing, medical care and, where appropriate, training for our animals until s/he is placed in a loving, carefully-screened new home. HART takes in older, sick, and injured animals as well as the readily adoptable and never takes just the pups and kittens, leaving mom behind. We seek to direct our resources where they are most needed and to alleviate or prevent suffering wherever we find it.
