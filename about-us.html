          <h2>I am a curious, problem-solver whose diverse background in broadcasting and teaching exposed me to a broad range of different personalities. Living abroad helped me develop interesting perspectives when I am presented with puzzles. I adapt well and have a love of learning; I believe every moment is a teachable one, and am continuously striving to understand more about the world. I studied software development and love how I am constantly challenged to grow. I would love to be part of a team that values quality and writes back-end programs.

            <h3>Charles is my name and I am many things beside a full stack web developer (though I do find myself humming Kip's ode to technology from the movie Napolean Dynamite quite often). 
  
                Family man, martial artist, veteran, author, comedian, gamer, bassist, public speaker; these are all labels that describe different aspects of myself. At the core I am a man that yearns for growth, a lifelong learner that spends more time researching, contemplating, and practicing than watching tv. 
                
                I believe in the chase and motivating others to chase after their own dreams makes me smile. 
                
                All too often the inner critic receives more attention than it deserves so everyone wins when we can keep it silent. The inner critic is a liar that does not want you to know the truth: that we can convert dreams, no matter how big, into circumstances as long as we are willing to put in the work to make that happen.

            <h3>My name is Kush Shrestha. I am a motivated self-starter who can successfully manage multiple projects and deadlines. I have bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. I worked as a Mechanical Engineer for Winco Inc in Le Center, Minnesota where I designed, modeled and simulated new and existing generators using engineering principle. I supported manufacturing, engineering for production of all the portable generators. After working in Winco INC for couple years, I joined the Military. I was tactical power generation specialist in military, where I primarily performed maintenance and repair on generators and internal combustion engines. While transitioning from military I wanted to work in IT field. I found out about this AWS Software Development Engineer apprenticeship program and it was exactly what I wanted to do. As a part of apprenticeship program, I am taking a course in Code Fellows to become a full stack Software Developer.

            <h3>I was worked as a HVAC technician in U.S. Army for four and half years. From this job I learned lots of experience. It teaches me to pay attention on details and follow the rules. I thinks these attributes also work in developing world. Without paying attention on details, you may miss a colon or curly bracket which results whole codes don’t work. Without following the programming language rules, the machine could not understand what we write. I decide to learn software development because I want to pick up what I learn from my school and use them as a tool to help people to have a easier life.
