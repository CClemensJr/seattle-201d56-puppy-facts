            <h1>Here are 15 reasons why you should look at rescuing an animal:</h1>
            
            <section>
                <div></div>
                <ol>
                    <li>The terms “humane society” and “SPCA” are generic; shelters using those names are not part of the ASPCA or The Humane Society of the United States.</li>
                    <li>Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.3 million are dogs and 3.2 million are cats</li>
                    <li>Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats).</li>
                    <li>It's estimated that 78 million dogs and 85.8 million cats are owned in the United States. Approximately 44% of all households in the United States have a dog, and 35% have a cat.</li>
                    <li>Once a pet is left at a shelter, it has about 72 hours to be adopted before it is destroyed.</li>
                </ol>

                <div></div>

                <ol>
                    <li>Only 1 out of every 10 dogs born will find a permanent home.</li>
                    <li>The main reasons animals are in shelters: owners give them up, or animal control finds them on the street.</li>
                    <li>About twice as many animals enter shelters as strays compared to the number that are relinquished by their owners.[</li>
                    <li>It’s impossible to determine how many stray dogs and cats live in the United States. Estimates for cats alone range up to 70 million.</li>
                    <li>Many strays are lost pets that were not kept properly indoors or provided with identification.</li>
                </ol>

                <div></div>
                <ol>
                    <li>There are about five homeless animals for every homeless person in the U.S.</li>
                    <li>Out of six to eight million cats and dogs, one in four animals brought into shelters are pit bulls.</li>
                    <li>Five out of every ten shelter dogs each year amounts to about 5,500 euthanized dogs every day.</li>
                    <li>To pay for all of this – the impoundment, sheltering, euthanasia and subsequent disposal of homeless animals – U.S. taxpayers shell out between one to two billion dollars annually.</li>
                    <li>Breeding cats and dogs for profit is unnecessary and unsustainable, and is resulting in the needless killing of millions of healthy, innocent animals every year.</li>
