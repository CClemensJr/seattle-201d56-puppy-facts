                <ol>
                    <li><span>-</span> 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.3 million are dogs and 3.2 million are cats</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats).</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> Once a pet is left at a shelter, it has about 72 hours to be adopted before it is destroyed.</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> If you have a home, there is no scientific reason why you should not have an animal living inside of it.</li>
                </ol>

                <div></div>

                <ol>
                    <li><span>-</span> Only 1 out of every 10 dogs born will find a permanent home.</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> The main reasons animals are in shelters: owners give them up, or animal control finds them on the street.</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> Itâ€™s impossible to determine how many stray dogs and cats live in the United States. Estimates for cats alone range up to 70 million.</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> U.S. taxpayers pay about 1.5 billion dollars annually for the impoundment, sheltering, euthanasia and subsequent disposal of homeless animals.</li> 
                </ol>

                <div></div>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>-</span> There are about five homeless animals for every homeless person in the U.S.</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> Out of six to eight million cats and dogs, one in four animals brought into shelters are pit bulls.</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> Five out of every ten shelter dogs each year amounts to about 5,500 euthanized dogs every day.</li>
                    <li><span>-</span> Breeding cats and dogs for profit is unnecessary and unsustainable, and is resulting in the needless killing of millions of healthy, innocent animals every year.</li>
