## Purpose:
The purpose of this website is help homeless animals find a new home.  

## Summary
Our website is user friendly. The home page provides the information about the homeless animals. Any user can use our website to input information about homeless animal for adoption. User will input animal name, type, age and color. After user inputs the information it automatically goes to the find a pet section where the homeless animal information can be viewed for adoption. In this section user can view the animals by type as well. If the animals get adopted, we also added a feature where admin can delete that animal.
